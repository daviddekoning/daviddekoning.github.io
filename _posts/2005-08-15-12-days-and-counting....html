and way too much to do.<br /><br />Do you ever feel like the future is a nebulous black cloud descending slowly over your thoughts, eyes and feelings?  That's usualy how I feel if I haven't completely quantified what I need to do - or at least understand what needs to be done to accomplish something.  Having never moved to Europe by myself (I was eight last time I did that, so my parents did most of the worrying), it's definitely got some nebulous black cloud action going on.<br /><br />But God is nice and He loves me and...let's not forget...He's been to Europe before, so he knows the deal.  I was worried about moving to Europe because it's pretty spiritually dead--or so I hear.  I still am, but then I remembered that Canada is pretty spiritually dead, too, but God still have faithful congregations where His children meet.
