of riches<br /><br /><blockquote><br />So He brought His people out with joy,<br />His chosen ones with singing,<br />He gave them the lands of the nations,<br />and they took possession of the wealth of the peoples,<br />that they might keep his statutes and observe His laws.<br />Praise the Lord!<br /><font size="-2">Psalm 105:43-45</font><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><br />Take care that you do not forget the Lord your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you today.  When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them, and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied, then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the Lord your God, who bought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the the house of slavery.<br /><font size="-2"> Deuteronomy 8:11-15</font><br /></blockquote>
