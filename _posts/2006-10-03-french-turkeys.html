not so large, it seems<br /><br />So this morning, I went turkey hunting.  Not turkey hunting in the usualy sense of the work hunting.  Instead of creeping about on foot, I took my bike.  Rather than moving steathily from copse to copse, I wore a bright orange fleece sweather as I moved from boucherie to boucherie.  Actually, I only found two, so it didn't actually take that long.<br /><br />Anyhow, the French tend to only order turkeys around the <strong>french</strong> holidays.  Strange, but anyways, it makes it difficult to find turkeys for Canadian thanksgiving.  Eventually (read: at the second boucherie) I was told that they might be able to get turkeys, but that they wouldn't me any larger than 4 kg.  4 kg!!  That's 9 pounds! A capon turkey, if you will.  When I asked for a 10-15 kg turkey, the dude laughed and said they didn't exist.  grrrr.....<br /><br />Sigh...<br /><br />France: where everything is smaller.<br /><br />(p.s. boucherie = meat shop.  Think European Meats in Kensington)
