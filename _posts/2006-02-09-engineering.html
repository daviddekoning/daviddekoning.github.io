poetry<br /><br />My TA said that reading my homework was like reading pure poetry.  This is quite possible the weirdest comment I've ever received on any homework, ever.  My english teachers never said that when I was *trying* to write poetry.<br /><br />At any rate, I decided to answer a question on my next assignment in haiku.  I have reproduced it below for your reading pleasure:<br /><br />Acceleration<br />that causes severe damage<br />is one point one g.<br /><br />Mind you, my first attempt had the wrong answer, so the lines came out a bit different:<br /><br />Acceleration<br />causing total collapse is<br />one point seven g.
