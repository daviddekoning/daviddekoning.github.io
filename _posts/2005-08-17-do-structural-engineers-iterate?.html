or do they merely repeat themselves?<br /><br />It seems to me that the civil engineering body of knowledge includes precious little knowledge of how to take on new design challenges.  Respected senior engineers develop a "feel" for how big structural members should be--which can be an advantage when designing the similar structures with similar materials, but a hinderance when breaking new ground, and by the way, this is a run-on sentence.<br /><br />Of course, I've spent a total of one undergraduate degree and 4 months of paid work in the engineering profession, so what do I really know?  (not much)  I still suspect that an aversness to change is going to frustrate me a lot if I do end up working as an engineer.
