<blockquote><br />"With what shall I come before the Lord,<br />and bow myself before God on High?<br />Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,<br />with calves a year old?<br /><br />Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,<br />with ten thousands of rivers of oil?<br />Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,<br />the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"<br /><br />He has told you, O mortal, what is good;<br />and what does the Lord require of you<br />but to do justice, and to love kindness,<br />and to walk humbly before your God?<br /><font size="-2">Micah 5:8</font><br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Is not this the fast that I choose:<br />to loose the bonds of injustice,<br />to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br />to let the oppressed go free,<br />and to break every yoke?<br /><br />Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,<br />and bring the homeless poor into your house;<br />when you see the naked, to cover them,<br />and not to hide yourself from your own kin?<br /><br />Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,<br />and your healing shall spring up quickly;<br />your vindicator shall go before you,<br />the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.<br /><br />Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer;<br />you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.<br /><font size="-2">Isaiah 58:6-9</font><br /></blockquote>
