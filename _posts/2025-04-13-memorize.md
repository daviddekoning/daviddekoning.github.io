title: A little app to help you memorize
---

When I was a kid, we would learn bible verse at camp or at Sunday School. Sometimes someone would write out the verse on cards, where there then stuck to a wall or a board. We would recite the verse, then the words would be progressively removed, one at a time. We would recite the verse with more and more words removed.

For a long time, I have thought it would be nice to have this as an app. You could say that it has been on my 'cool ideas' backlog for years.

Today, I did it, in about 10 minutes, vibe coding using Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Gemini 2.5 Experimental. I used the [llm](https://llm.datasette.com) tool which allowed me to start a conversation with Claude, and switch to Gemini halfway through, all while retaining the conversation history. When I switched to Gemini, I just said "Can you improve this code?" What a wild world we live in.

Anyways, here is the final ouput: [The Dissappearing Text Memorizer](/images/words.html).
