and I missed it.<br /><br />Today was the annual Christine-is-in-town CDA meeting.  We seem to have outgrown our "cliquey" stage because there were many faces that were new to the CDA, which is exciting.  Anyways, one of those faces was Elissa.  I looked up from the couch to see her carrying not one, but two ibooks.  It turns out she was having an ibook party with Mike, who who had also brought his.<br /><br />my ibook, however, was sleeping at home.  So I couldn't join the party.  All I could do feel like a cool kid as I watched Mike make exclamations of desire concerning the two-fingered scrolling capability of Elissa's new ibook.  "yeah, that's right, mine does that too"<br /><br />oh boy.  it's just a computer, dave, it's just a computer...
