says<br /><br />that the secret of a good blog is to quote other people funnier than yourself.  In an effort to raise quel shake? to that exalted level, here is a quote from the Toronto Star's Garnet Fraser, discussing the state of drivers on the Don Valley parking lot:<br /><br />"But are these drivers happy? Not by a long shot. They're grinding their teeth, fuming at an oversight by a spouse (whom they love) or a slight at work (where their money is made). They're snarling about something wrong with their house or their family. And if all of those things are perfect, there's always the Leafs."<br /><br />ah yes...the Leafs...there's always the leafs...
