<strong> new city, new leaf </strong>

I have just moved to Montreal and thought I'd take the opportunity to restart my blog. I've imported the posts from my previous blog, [Quel Shake?](http://quel-shake.blogspot.com), and am ready to have another go at sharing my thoughts.

As you can tell from my previous posts, my blog was basically a net to catch all the random thoughts passing through my mind. This time around, I'll give it some more focus. These are the main things I am going to include in this blog going forward:

* book reviews and excerpts
* projects
* essays

Here goes nothing!
