the quality of being amphibious<br /><br />I have a new theory of amphibuity: things spelled with 'ph' are amphibious.<br /><br />For instance, phrogs, as we all know are amphibious, so that's one point to my theory right off the bat.<br /><br />Now I know what you're thinking: Phones.  Phones are spelled with 'ph', but are they amphibious?  Well, the latest research says yes...<br /><br />I was sticking my feet in a cold mountain stream today and decided that I would put my mobile phone in my shoe to keep it from falling out of my pocket and into said cold mountain stream.  You see, I too did not think that phones were amphibious.  But I underestimated the amphibuity of my phone and it took a dive right out of the shoe and into the stream.  I retrieved it, dissasembled it and let it dry for about 5 hours.  and then...DUM DUM DUM!!...it worked as if nothing had happened.  Ergo, phones are amphibious and my new theory is going to revolutionize zoology the world over.<br /><br />The only bummer is that for about five hours I was convincing myself that I would have get a new phone but now that my old one works....no new phone for david :(  NOKIA!!! I'll get those quality finnish engineers one of these days...
