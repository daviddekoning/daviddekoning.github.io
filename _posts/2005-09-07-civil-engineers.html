don't iterate<br /><br />In class today, our prof (an establish and well respected engineer)  told us that once we had completed a conceptual design, we would have to live with it.  So in the first two weeks of work (or so) all the important decisions will be made and that is that.<br /><br /><br />boo.  erns.<br /><br />The hole will be dug, the steel will be ordered and the architect won't allow you to change your mind.  Apparently, that's an architects perogative.
