says:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />But when I am a creature in the presence of God, and see that the last relationship is with an infinite God, and these human relationships are among equals, I can take from human relationship what God meant it to provide, without putting the whole structure under an intolerable burden.  More than this, when I acknowledge that none of us are perfect in this life, I can enjoy that which is beautiful in a relationship, without expecting it to be perfect.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />the one advantage to having insomnia, is that you have more time to read books...
