but your stomach doesn't go<br /><br />Terrifying feeling, but it's usually ok, since you end up lying in bed.<br /><br />What's terrifying is when a gaping hole opens up in real life and you say to yourself "I guess I'll be jumping into that before too long".  And you've told yourself that it's a gaping hole and you know it's dangerous but then you catch yourself about to throw yourself into oblivion.<br /><br />Without a rope.  It's ok to throw yourself into oblivion if you know you've got a good rope.  I guess I'll have to find one of those in the next year and a half.
