is crazy<br /><br />A crazy person is someone who's concept of reality, of the world they live in, has no bearing on, well, reality.<br /><br />Everyone notices different parts of the reality that is common to all of us.  No two people will see the same scene and walk away with the exact same impression.<br /><br />That's why it's so nice to talk to someone who agrees with you or who gets excited about the same thing as you.  It means that either you're both crazy in exactly the same way (which is, of course, a possibility) or that you're both talking about the same thing that exists outside of both of you.<br /><br />So the next time you're caught next to someone who's talking and talking and talking and talking and talking....don't hate, just tell them they're not crazy, it's all they want to hear.
