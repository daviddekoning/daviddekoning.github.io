but not of it<br /><br />It occured to me today that my time in Europe will be a good opportunity to think about how a christian should interact with society.  Back home, I feel as if I'm a member of Canadian society--as if I partly belong to it.  I end up asking how I bring my relationship with Jesus into my relationship with other Canadians.  My personal preferences--which is how other Canadians would see the outcomes of my walk w/ Jesus--have as much validity as those of other Canadians because I am of Canada.  I am Canadian.<br /><br />But I'm not Italian.  It is not my country, I don't belong there.  By watching myself, I'll hopefully be able to find out what it means to in a place, without being of it.  In Canada, I belong to Christ and (sort-of) to Canada, or canadian society, anyways...  Now the tension is gone (temporarily) b/c I certainly don't belong to Italy.  The trick is to pray and learn throughout the experience to become fully Christ's when I do go back to Canada.
