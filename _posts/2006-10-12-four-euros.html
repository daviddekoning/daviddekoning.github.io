worth of excitement<br /><br />I met someone yesterday who was very excited about four euros, excited enough to start kissing random strangers.<br /><br />Are four euros really that exciting?  Sure thing.  Four euros is a croissant, a coffee and a then a pain au chocolat because you've still got the munchies.  It could also be a sandwich for lunch, three rides on the tram or two big coins that you can stick over your eyes and pretend are monocles!<br /><br />So next time you look in your wallet and all you see is four euros (or six canadian dollars), just remember: you've got a pocketful of excitment.
