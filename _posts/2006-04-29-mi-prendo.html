in giro<br /><br />literally "you take me for a tour", but means "you're pulling my leg".<br /><br />The other day, I got all worried because I saw a sign announcing that all regional and interregional trains on the Milano-Genova line were going to be cancelled for a year!  This is bad, b/c it essentially means that I wouldn't be able to spend evenings in Milano...<br /><br />So after a week or two of worry, I finally figured out that my leg was, in fact, being pulled.  sigh.... at least the 00h27 train still runs!
