title: Reading the news vs. reading a book
---

Reading is reading, no? Why does reading the news seem so different from reading a novel?
Here are a few thoughts:

## Half-way there

The news, since it is often still happened (!) is unresolved. The story is never really 
over, you are always left in suspense, knowing that more will come.

In a novel, the author takes you on a whole narrative arc. Even when a book ends without
resolution, it is deliberate: you are meant to understand that the unresolution is as
much as you'll get.

## Taking a next step

The news talks about events that have some effect on your life, but rarely give you enough 
context or detail for you to take specific action. It raises your anxiety without
positionning you to make decisions and take action.

Novels let you escape the day to day and (hopefully!), give you outlooks and attitudes
that help you make sense of the world and orient yourself when you return.

## Thoughfulness

The news is produced on a brutal schedule, and as result it's emphasis is on sharing
the raw information as quickly as possible.

Novels, being produced on a longer schedule, are just are just a little less hectic...
